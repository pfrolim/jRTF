jRTF
====

jRTF is a simple library to generate RTF documents and to fill RTF template files. The syntax is compact and non-verbose which makes it to some kind of DSL (domain specific language) for RTF documents. It's published under the BSD license.

### Credits

This project is a "FORK" from [jRTF][1] (revision 7) from [Christian Ullenboom][2].

That API is nice and easy to use, but a lot of features that I needed were not implemented yet.

In fact, since the last commit was made in 2011, soon I realized that I should better implement what I need by myself.

This project here is where I am tracking my efforts. All original credits and license stuff are maintained.
